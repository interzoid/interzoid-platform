  title: Interzoid AI Custom Data API
  description: >
    This API enables you to generate and append custom external data to a
    single input value in real time using AI models, machine learning, and
    specialized algorithms. You define the topic and output fields you want,
    and the API returns structured JSON that matches your specification.

    Typical use cases include enriching CRM and marketing data, adding
    business or demographic attributes for analytics, and generating
    additional fields for AI and machine learning training datasets.

    To use this API, you need an API key. Register for an API key at
    https://www.interzoid.com/register-api-account.

    For more information about this API, visit:
    https://www.interzoid.com/apis/ai-custom-data.

    You can also try this API interactively at https://data.interzoid.com
    (AI Interactive Data Client) or use it in high-speed batch mode at
    https://batch.interzoid.com.

      summary: Generate custom data for a single input value
      description: >
        Generates custom, AI-enriched data for a single input value (the
        `lookup` parameter) based on a topic and list of output fields that
        you define.

        This API is ideal for:
        - Enriching CRM and marketing records
        - Adding external business or demographic attributes
        - Creating additional features for analytics and AI models
        - Real-time data retrieval to power applications and workflows

        You can provide your API key either as:

        * A `license` query parameter, or
        * An `x-api-key` HTTP header (recommended for production).

        Register for an API key at https://www.interzoid.com/register-api-account.

            Your API license key when passed via query string. Register for an
            API key at https://www.interzoid.com/register-api-account.

            For production, it is recommended to use the `x-api-key` header
            instead of the query string.

            The AI model configuration to use for this request. Different
            models control which sources are used, depth of enrichment, and
            performance characteristics.

            Common values include:
            * `default` - Default AI model for the API.
            * `model-a` - Standard model with broad coverage.
            * `model-a-premium` - Higher-depth model with additional data
              sources; recommended for richer enrichment.
            * `model-x` - Alternative model optimized for certain use cases.
            * `model-x-premium` - Higher-depth version of `model-x`.
